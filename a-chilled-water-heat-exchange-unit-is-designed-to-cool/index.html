<p>Air-to Water Heat Exchangers are a very simple and reliable cooling andor heating option for smaller spaces with basic climate control needs. The water brings the heat back to the chiller where the compression cycle cools the water before it is returned to the heat process. It returns to the evaporator where the refrigerant absorbs the unwanted heat and directs it to the condenser. Chillers use the refrigeration cycle to remove heat from chilled water. 40rt R22 To Water B3 200 38 38d Small Size Heat Exchanger As Evaporator Of Oil Cooler Replace Vic Heat Exchanger Heat Pump Water Heater Home Heating Systems.</p>
