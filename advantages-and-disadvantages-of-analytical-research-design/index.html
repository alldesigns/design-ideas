It does not consider any facts or findingsOn the other hand an analytical research answers questions why how when and by whom the incident happened.

These cross-sectional advantages and disadvantages show us that a massive undertaking of simultaneous data collection can provide unique results that can benefit an entire population group.</p>

Quantitative research requires careful experimental design and the ability for anyone to replicate both the test and the results. It does not consider any facts or findingsOn the other hand an analytical research answers questions why how when and by whom the incident happened. That means researchers can collect the data for their own purposes then another set of researchers can use the same data for a different purpose. This may breach privacy of the customers as their information such as purchases online transactions subscriptions are visible to their parent companies. As well as controlling the independent variable the experimenter attempts to eliminate unwanted extraneous variables Control over extraneous variables is usually greater than in other research methods.</p>

<p>The Descriptive Analysis is criticized for its incapability to show cause and effect and predictions for example the relationship between two variables cannot be concluded as causal relationship. Furthermore the Quality by Design approach for optimizing formulation methods has several advantages such as reducing the number of experiments cost-effectiveness and considerably less. Researchers can focus on these strengths and weaknesses in order to implement a research design that can account for them.

<p>Answer the what not the why. Qualitative data are information personal details or answers gotten directly from a source which could be human or virtual when conducting a market research. However this type of study is limited in its ability to draw valid conclusions about any association or possible causality because the presence of risk factors and outcomes are measured simultaneously.
