<p><strong>Ball And Socket Design</strong>, The reverse prosthesis designed by Paul Grammont unlike any previous reverse ball-and-socket design has introduced 2 major innovations that have led to its success. During my stay as an Artist in Residence at Instructables I was able to witness firsthand how awesome 3D printing can be. When designing ball joints it is best to make them an exact fit where the positive part the ball and the negative part the socket are the exact same circumference.</p>

<p>With this process you utilize 2 different materials. The mechanism could tolerate significant initial misalignment because it would include an alignment cone that would guide the ball into the socket. These end fittings snap right on a ball stud an integral retaining clip grips the ball stud for secure attachment until you apply enough force to pop it off. The MatOrtho medial ball-and-socket knee design consistently achieves superior functional performance and excellent survivorship.</p>
