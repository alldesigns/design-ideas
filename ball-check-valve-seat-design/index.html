<p>When choosing an industrial valve you will face numerous choices. Designing a ball check valve starts with the diameter of the through hole. The metal-seated specialty-coated ball closes tightly against a set of precision coated and lapped seats providing zero-leakage if the hardened seating surfaces are not scratched by debris in the line. The full-ported valve seat is uniquely designed allowing the ball to seat leak-tight without getting wedge into the valve seat.</p>

When choosing an industrial valve you will face numerous choices. A Ball Check Valve is a simple and reliable valve with the only moving part to block the reverse flow is a spherical ball. A floating design ball valve sandwiches the hollow ball between two or more cupped seats that form a tight seal between the body and the ball at the inlet and outlet ports of the valve body. A double-disc or wafer check valve consists of two half-circle disks hinged together. -300F to 450F -184C to 232C O-Ring dependent.</p>

<p>The ball rotates with the valve stem to achieve the opening and closing action. The diameter of the through hole is determined by the required flow rate which is in turn dictated by the Reynolds number the fluid pressure and the Kinematic viscosity of the solution or gas. Typically we hard face a stainless steel seat with Stellite then lap the ball to the seat for tight shut-off.

<p>An important dimension in a check valve is the distance the ball rises out of its seat. This feature makes ball checks useful for viscous media. For this reason most ball valves are referred to as quarter-turn valves.

<p>The metal-seated ball valve design has enabled ball valves to take a big chunk out of the market share dominated for decades by the venerable gate valve. Can be used with steam air gas water and vapor lines with high flow velocities can be installed in lines with vertical flow available with renewable seat rings. The seat design of a lift-check valve is similar to a globe valve. In an HPLC device a pair of check valve inlet outlet prevent the flow from a high-pressure area into the low-pressure area because of which there is a continuous flow through the column at high pressure.

<p>The double piston effect seat design in the API 6D is also called the Double-Isolation-and-Bleed Valve DIB Valve. Ball valve is mainly constructed of valve body seat ball valve stem handle or other driving device. A floating design ball valve sandwiches the hollow ball between two or more cupped seats that form a tight seal between the body and the ball at the inlet and outlet ports of the valve body. The metal-seated ball valve design has enabled ball valves to take a big chunk out of the market share dominated for decades by the venerable gate valve.

<p>This feature makes ball checks useful for viscous media. A double-disc or wafer check valve consists of two half-circle disks hinged together. The ball-lift check valves are used in highly viscous fluid service. However like all other valves ball valves are generally rated at a lower pressure for steam service than for liquid or dry gaseous service.
