<p>The program emphasis is on research and theory VS design and during the course of study you will learn. Students in our program apply a sophisticated level of design thinking and design research approaches to the planning and development of public and private interior environments of all scales with a strong emphasis. Inspired by the excellence of the Department of Construction Management and Interior Design California Closets has established an annually funded scholarship to assist an interior design student at Ball State. The rigorous and innovative Interior Design program of Ball State University will equip you to be a professional interior designer as well as to develop and hone your creative processes in your pursuit of design excellence.
