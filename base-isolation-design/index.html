In context of seismic design of structures base isolation. The idea that a building can be uncoupled from the damaging effects of the ground movement produced by a strong earthquake has appealed to inventors and engineers for more than a century. Base isolation system is the frequently adopted earthquake resistance system. The paper is aiming towards design of different types of base isolators namely Lead Rubber Bearing LRB High Damping Rubber bearing HDR and Friction Pendulum System FPS.
