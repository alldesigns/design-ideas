<p>An Energy Storage System ESS is a specific type of power system that integrates a power grid connection with a Victron Inver-terCharger GX device and battery system. Battery energy storage systems have bi-directional inverters that allow for both charging and discharging. The battery system is composed by the several battery packs and multiple batteries inter-connected to reach the target value of current and voltage The battery management system that controls the proper operation of each cell in order to let the system work within a voltage current and temperature that is not dangerous for the system itself but good operation of the batteries. Battery management systems BMSs can supervise batteries operating in a diversity of devices and applications.</p>
