<p><strong>Bay Area Resilient By Design</strong>, We formed a global design collective with exactly that ambition for the Resilient by Design Bay Area Challenge a project that has the community and public officials working with local national and international experts on the challenges of climate change and ecological disaster around the bay. The Resilient by Design Bay Area Challenge It is hard to imagine the world we live in will become radically different over the next 25 to 75 years. The Resilient By Design Bay Area Challenge brought together nine multi-disciplinary design teams to develop resilient solutions to climate change-induced sea level rise and severe flooding and seismic impacts at various sites around the San Francisco Bay.</p>
