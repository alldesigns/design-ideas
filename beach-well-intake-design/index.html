How To Intake Seawater For Desalination Plant From kysearo.com</p>
<p>A comprehensive study for the Middle East Desalination Research Centre MEDRC on non-surface seawater intakes for small seawater reverse osmosis systems developed design criteria for these types of intakes. Generally it consists of masonry or concrete intake chamber of rectangular shape admitting water through a coarse screen. A sea water intake system has to be designed and constructed to ensure sufficient sea water in terms of quantity and quality. Perforated pipes are arranged in a radial pattern in the sand onshore below the water level.</p>

Comparison of Intake and Water Treatment Plant Siting Options Associated Engineering May 2011 2. Perforated pipes are arranged in a radial pattern in the sand onshore below the water level. This capacity of 16000 m 3 per km 2 might be useful for a medium-size reverse osmosis plant like the MED plant currently operating in Dukhan Township and they can be used to artificially recharging the aquifer. 2 DEFINITIONS 21 Pump Sump A lined excavation generally of a simple geometric shape adjacent to the pump intake. The intakes consists of opening strainer or grating through which water enters and conduit conveying the water usually by gravity to a well.</p>
