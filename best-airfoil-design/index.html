A leading edge flap increases the curvature of the top of the airfoil. High-energy flow is exerted on the top surface of the airfoil although this is not to facilitate a bigger camber but rather to utilize a higher angle of attack for the existing camber of the wing profile.

<p>Compare the drag coefficient of candidate airfoils when they are at this design lift coefficient to find the one that has the lowest drag at the actual cruise condition of the airplane you are designing. When used in a GA aircraft this might be a bit conservative but could fit well to your low speed requirements. The Clark-Y airfoil is widely used in general purpose aircraft designs and much studied in aerodynamics over the years its one of the most common designs used in model airplanes many variations can be used thickness flat bottom etc. The Lissaman 7769 was designed for human-powered aircraft.

<p>The new airfoil design should be able to produce higher ClCd or the glide ratio for all the range of Reynolds number ie. This so-called laminar airfoil is designed for fullscale sailplanes vertical stabilizers for Re at least 1000000 for minimum drag and high efficiency. Compare the drag coefficient of candidate airfoils when they are at this design lift coefficient to find the one that has the lowest drag at the actual cruise condition of the airplane you are designing. It is far from accidental that there is a basic similarity between the wings of birds and the wings of airplanes.
