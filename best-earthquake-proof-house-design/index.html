<p>Each house design is individually engineered to meet local seismic code requirements and to adapt to the natural terrain utilizing one of the many foundation options available from Topsider. Instead of just counteracting forces researchers are experimenting with ways buildings can deflect and reroute the energy from earthquakes altogether. Earthquake resistant design of buildings depends upon providing the building with strength stiffness and inelastic deformation capacity which are great enough to withstand a given level of earthquake-generated force. Factors such as proximity to fault lines ground soil nearby natural features such as hills and oceans building age and building condition all play a role in your homes vulnerability to earthquakes.</p>
<h3 id="concrete-is-very-good-at-resisting-damage-and-wood-is-great-for-building-a-good-strong-frame-in-this-case">Concrete is very good at resisting damage and wood is great for building a good strong frame in this case.</h3><p>Three centimeters of levitation will only protect a house from earthquakes that dont rise higher than three centimeters. The first step to earthquake-proofing your house is to research your home location and structural history. We regularly have owners of our Solid Timber homes contact us or write public reviews saying how safe they felt in their homes during the earthquakes. The objective of this document is to provide rural households with clear guidance regarding earthquake resistant construction techniques and to support them to have house designs in compliance with the National Building Code of Nepal.
