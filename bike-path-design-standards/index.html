<p>The Guide provides advice on the design of paths for safe and efficient walking and cycling both within and outside the road corridor including pedestrian paths bicycle paths or cycle tracks shared paths and separated paths. The conditions of the existing roadway needs to be assessed specifically intersections and the merging of bike paths with the main roadway. Standard cycle types in single lane facilities or where a high proportion of non-standard cycles may be present to allow passing each other.
