<p>Todays vehicles with their high horsepower have made this type of wheel construction obsolete. The standard commercial bicycle frame diagram is show below. The process of fitting spokes when building a bicycle wheel is known as lacing presumably because theyre passed through holes and then tightened like shoelaces. Everything but the wheel frame seat and handle bars.</p>
<h3 id="we-will-just-the-overall-material-importance-for-the-components">We will just the overall material importance for the components.</h3><p>If the diameter of a wheel is 07 metres then the circumference is 3142 x 07 22 metres. Light alloy wheels have developed in recent years a design to emphasize this spoke effect to. The safety bicycle that was developed in the 1880s closely resembles the bicycles of today.
