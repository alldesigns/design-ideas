<p>Process design with MBBR is based on the concept that treatment is achieved with several reactors in series and that each individual reactor is designated for a specific treatment function within the greater treatment scheme. This suggests that surface-active molecules involved in biofilm formation have a real interest for the design of single-species biofilm reactors. However with the right procedure to follow you do not need an expert to help you in the design process of the MBBR.
