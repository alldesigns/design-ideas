By studying individual flora and fauna and natural systems designers businesses and engineers are creating viable new systems and products. Scientific research in the field of biology alone has already shed light on natures successes and failures throughout billions of years of evolution life flourishing today has successfully evolved while fossils provide evidence of natures inability to overcome diverse challenges. Their new surface is essentially omniphobic is composed of low cost materials and self heals. It is the quest and mission of a biomimicry practitioner to unveil nature knowledge and learn how to apply these patterns into its design. Biomimicry as its called is a method for creating solutions to human challenges by emulating designs and ideas found in nature.</p>
