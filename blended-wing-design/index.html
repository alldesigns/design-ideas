<p>May 19 2016 Supervisor. Researches have shown that this design concept offers a significant improvement in the aerodynamic efficiency yet the concept has to be developed for the commercial transport aircrafts. The blended wing body design continued to be evaluated the design requirements changed slightly by reducing the passenger count to 468 passengers and increasing the range to 7750nm this aircraft was called the BWB 450 Ordoukhanian Madni 2014. The high level of integration between the wing.</p>

Blended Wing Body BWB is an idea where the fuselage of an aircraft blends with the wing and tail forming a hybrid shape that resembles a flying wing 1. The BWB is a unique tailless aircraft. This configuration incorporates design features from conventional fuselage as well as traditional flying wing. The benefits of the blended wing design are traditionally tied to efficiency from weight loss. Aesthetics comes later.</p>

<p>The high level of integration between the wing. The Blended Wing Body BWB is a tailless design that integrates the wing and the fuselage and was initially conceived towards the end of the 20th century to serve as a novel platform for high-speed subsonic commercial airliners In the general case it consists of a middle section center body or fuselage and an outer section wing whereas the part in between is the blending area where.

<p>Like the B-2 the BWB design uses composite materials that are stronger and lighter than conventional metal construction. The benefits of the blended wing design are traditionally tied to efficiency from weight loss. In this concept wide airfoil-shaped body is smoothly blended with high lift wings which means that the entire aircraft contributes to the generation of lift thereby.
