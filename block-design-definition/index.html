<p>Place each plant in one of the six blocks based on their field. Generate all of the possible treatment arrangements. The designs in which every block receives all the treatments are called the complete block designs. In experimental psychology refers to a design which systematically divides participants into homogenous groups blocks.</p>
<h3 id="design-reuse-software-tool">Design reuse software tool.</h3><p>Generate all of the possible treatment arrangements. The elements of P are called points and the elements of B are called blocks I denote the incidence relation between P and B. Blocking is a technique for dealing with nuisance factors ie. An experimental design as in horticulture in which different treatments are distributed in random order in a block or plot called also randomized block design. A variable which is not of interest except that it has some influence on the variables that are of interest. When all treatments appear at least once in each block we have a completely randomized block design.</p>
