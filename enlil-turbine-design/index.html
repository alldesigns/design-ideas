<p><strong>Enlil Turbine Design</strong>, The comparison of the hybrid design with the conventional wind turbines were carried out by comparing their performance indexes such as efficiency torque and tip-speed ratio. It has been designed to both harvests the energy from the natural wind as well as those created by passing vehicles. By placing the hybrid vertical axis wind turbine inclueding a solar panel on top of it on highways Metrobus-lines and other transportation lines as well as high-rise residences ENLIL will generate energy by using the winds created by the vehicles aswell as the natural winds.</p>

<p>Varatharaj LAyyadurai SPalani. The principal objective of this project is design modelling and simulation of a Darrieus rotor Vertical Axis Wind Turbine. By placing the hybrid vertical axis wind turbine inclueding a solar panel on top of it on highways Metrobus-lines and other transportation lines as well as high-rise residences ENLIL will generate energy by using the winds created by the vehicles aswell as the natural winds. A vertical axis wind turbine with a turbine rotor with rotor blades disposed for rotation about a substantially vertical axis. Enlil Is A Smart Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Project That Transforms Highways Into Renewable En Vertical Axis Wind Turbine Small Wind Turbine Alternative Energy.</p>
