<p>Multiple vessels can be used to allow operating flexibility and backwashing from in-service filters. When the filtration process is completed the dry filter cake is discharged by use of a vibrator. Pressure Leaf Filters are pressure vessels with vertical mounted leafs accumulated on central outlet filter manifold. They are applied for the polishing slurries with very low solids content of 1-5 or for cake filtration with a solids concentration of 20-25.</p>

Hydraulic hand pump special mechanical jack are installed for cover lifting as and when required. Vertical Pressure Leaf Filters are quite similar to the Horizontal Plate Filters except for the orientation of the filter elements which are vertical rather than horizontal. As the cycle progresses the pressure drop across the leaves increases while volumetric flow rate. In a vertical pressure leaf filter the rectangular filter leaves are mounted vertically in a vertical oriented tank and are connected to a filter manifold at the bottom of the tank.
